My first PHP project (simple content management system).
An example of procedural/structured programming paradigm. The web application contains files where a common functionality is declared (functions). These files are then included where appropriate so the functions can be accessed.

The application's main features:
- Subject CRUD
- Page CRUD
- Admin user creation
- User Authentication with SHA-1 encryption
- User Authorisation using cookies and sessions
